link:http://sourceware.org/libffi/[libffi] is one of the most commonly used libraries
to implement foreign function interfaces in programming languages or frameworks.

While Go has an amazing built-in functionality to interoperate with C functions, the
usage of the CGO pseudo interfaces is not very intuitive. Especially in combination
with dynamic libraries (_dlopen_, _dlsym_, _dlclose_) the complexity increases
exponentially.

libgoffi implements a wrapper library to not only load dynamic libraries into the
applications memory space (using link:https://github.com/achille-roussel/go-dl[go-dl]
by link:https://github.com/achille-roussel[Achille Roussel]), but also map imported
functions onto Go function types, using libffi's common foreign function interface.

In addition libgoffi can map the most commonly used data types between Go and C
bi-directionally.

**Attention:** libgoffi might run on Go compiler versions lower than 1.12, this is
not tested though. Pull requests to support older and newer versions are welcome
though.

== Supported Data Types

libgoffi currently supports the most common Go data types. Automatic data type
mapping may also be applied.

Mapping for the following data types is implemented:

.Data Type Mapping
|===
| Go Data Type | C Data Type | libffi Data Type

| uint | uint16_t / uint32_t | ffi_type_uint16 / ffi_type_uint32
| uint8 | uint8_t | ffi_type_uint8
| uint16 | uint16_t | ffi_type_uint16
| uint32 | uint32_t | ffi_type_uint32
| uint64 | uint64_t | ffi_type_uint64
| int8 | int8_t | ffi_type_sint8
| int16 | int16_t | ffi_type_sint16
| int32 | int32_t | ffi_type_sint32
| int64 | int64_t | ffi_type_sint64
| float32 | float_t | ffi_type_float
| float64 | double_t | ffi_type_double
| unsafe.Pointer | void * | ffi_type_pointer
| uintptr | void * | ffi_type_pointer
| safe pointers (&var) | void * | ffi_type_pointer
| - | void | ffi_type_void
|===

**Attention:** The Go types _uint_ and _int_ mapping is platform specific and is
determined by looking at the maximum value of a signed int in C. Please be aware
when automatically mapping those data types.

**Attention:** Mapping of structs is not supported. It is also recommended to create
all pointers that need to be passed to C code to allocate using _C.malloc(â€¦)_ to
prevent the Go runtime to catch the "_Go Pointer to Go Pointer_" exception.

**Attention:** When passing a String to a function, remember, that it is mapped to
a _char *_ data type. That means, it will have an added _0x00_ (_\0_) byte at the end.
Therefore, if passing a length for a string, remember to add one byte (_len(msg)+1_).

**Attention:** Returning a _char *_ from a function in C (which is uncommon) and
mapping it into a String in Go, the actual returned C pointer will be immediately
freed after mapping. If this is not requested, the mapping should return the _char *_
itself and transformation into a Go String (using _C.GoString(ptr)_) should be done
manually.

== Supported Operating Systems

lobgoffi should support almost every posix compliant OS, there is, however, only
code for Linux and OSX (Darwin).

A few lines of code should make it possible to support operating systems like
FreeBSD or similar. Pull requests to add support for other operating systems are
welcome.

**Windows** is not supported, since Windows does not support dlopen, dlsym and dlclose.
It might possible to support the WinAPI functions to load .DLL files though. Again
pull requests adding support for Windows are welcome.

== Not Supported

* lobgoffi does not support signature checking. When executing an imported function using
a wrong function signature, your program might just return a wrong value. In the worst
case, however, it may actually crash with a segmentation fault or another exception
of any kind.

* As mentioned above, Windows, at the moment, is also not supported, as are any other posix
compliant operating systems other than Linux and OSX (Darwin). In theory any posix OS
supported by both Go and libffi should be possible to support though.

* Mapping of Go structs is not supported and not the subject of this library adapter. Pointers
to Go memory are always complicated to handle, and error prone. More information on CGO
interaction and Go pointers can be found in the
link:https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/#hdr-Passing_pointers[official Go documentation].

* Furthermore function pointers are not officially supported or tested, but may work when
exported as C functions. This might be officially supported in the future though.

== Loading a Library

Thanks to the _go-dl_ library which is used to load the underlying dynamic library,
libgoffi tries hard to automatically determine the actual path of a library.

Loading a library is normally as easy as asking by its name:

[source,go]
----
import (
  goffi "github.com/clevabit/libgoffi"
)

library := goffi.NewLibrary("libc", goffi.BindNow|goffi.BindGlobal)
----

libgoffi provides some binding flags of the posix API, more specifically:

* BindLazy
* BindNow
* BindLocal
* BindGlobal

The binding flags are XOR'ed together before being passed to the loader.

More information on those flags can be found in the
link:https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlopen[Linux manpages].

== Import Functions

Importing functions from the loaded library is provided using 3 different ways
depending on how much type mapping is necessary and how complex function types
are designed.

=== Fully Automatic Data Type Mapping

libgoffi is able to provide a fully automatic type mapping, which is probably
enough to map the most common functions.

The following example expects the _libc_ library to already being loaded into
the application as shown in the previous section.

[source,go]
----
// Make a function definition matching the native function's signature
type getpid = func() int

// Create a Go variable of the function type
var fn getpid

// Import the getpid function and map it to the target variable
if err := library.Import("getpid", &fn); err != nil {
  // error handling
}

// Execute the function like it was a standard Go function
println(fmt.sprintf("pid: %d", fn()))
----

In this example we imported the _getpid_ function from libc, which in itself returns
the pid (process identifier) of the currently running application, that said, our
demo application.

This mapping type also works for functions that expect a set of parameters.

[source,go]
----
type sqrt = func(float64) float64

var fn sqrt
if err := library.Import("sqrt", &fn); err != nil {
  // error handling
}
println(fmt.sprintf("sqrt of 9.0: %f", fn(9.)))
----

It is also always possible to map out error return types as the last parameter of the
function definition. Those will not be mapped out to the C function signature, but used
by the library to report errors during execution of the function, like illegal parameter
values.

An example of such a function mapping would be (using the sqrt example again):

[source,go]
----
type sqrt = func(float64) (float64, error)

var fn sqrt
if err := library.Import("sqrt", &fn); err != nil {
  // error handling
}
sq, err := fn(9.)
if err != nil {
  // error handling
}
println(fmt.sprintf("sqrt of 9.0: %f", sq))
----

If errors are not reported back as part of the function signature, libgoffi will resort
to panics to report the malfunctioning behavior.

=== New Function Import

In addition to map a C function to an existing variable of a specific Go function
type, libgoffi can also create function mappers for freely defined reflective
function definitions.

For example we go and import both of the above functions again, but this time using
the constructor function.

[source,go]
----
// Create a new function which returns an int and an error (the true)
fn, err := library.NewImport("getpid", goffi.TypeInt, true)
if err != nil {
  // error handling
}

// Type assertion to the specific function type
getpid, ok := fn.(func()(int, error))
if !ok {
  // error handling
}

// Execute the function like it was a standard Go function
println(fmt.sprintf("pid: %d", getpid()))
----

In this example we mapped the _getpid_ function again and told the mapper we also want
to report errors back. Remember, not reporting errors might result in a runtime panic
in case of problems.

To map the returned function to a callable variable, type assertions are used which also
provide automatic type checking.

For the next example we will not map out errors though (for the purpose of presentation).

[source,go]
----
fn, err := library.NewImport("sqrt", goffi.TypeFloat64, false, goffi.TypeFloat64)
if err != nil {
  // error handling
}

sqrt, ok := fn.(func(float64) float64)
if !ok {
  // error handling
}

println(fmt.sprintf("sqrt of 9.0: %f", sqrt(9.)))
----

=== Complex Data Type Mapping

Sometimes, however, a more complex type mapping is necessary. This is especially the
case, when the there is no automatic mapping for a library specific C data type.

libgoffi provides a specific mapper function for this use case, which is able to
be provided with a Go and C side function type definition.

libgoffi will make most out of these two function signatures and tries hard to map
the given C type to the Go type, and vise versa.

Another use case, is to map number types in C or Go to another data type in the
other respective language.

This is what we will do in this example when passing an int to the _sqrt_ function.
A bad example, I know, but it makes usage clear ;-)

[source, go]
----
fnGo := reflect.FuncOf(
  []reflect.Type{goffi.TypeInt},     // input types
  []reflect.Type{goffi.TypeInt},     // output types
  false,                             // non-variadic
)

fnC := reflect.FuncOf(
  []reflect.Type{goffi.TypeFloat64}, // input types
  []reflect.Type{goffi.TypeFloat64}, // output types
  false,                             // non-variadic
)

fn, err := library.NewImportComplex("sqrt", fnGo, fnC)
if err != nil {
  // error handling
}

sqrt, ok := fn.(func(int) int)
if !ok {
  // error handling
}

println(fmt.sprintf("sqrt of 9: %f", sqrt(9)))
----

== Closing a Loaded Library

libgoffi uses internal caches to store state and loaded symbols. Furthermore it also
allocates memory outside of the Go heap. That said, a loaded library needs to be
closed explicitly to free allocated resources.

A simple call to the _Close()_ function is enough.

[source,go]
----
if err := library.Close(); err != nil {
  // error handling
}
----
